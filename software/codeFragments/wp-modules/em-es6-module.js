// EXPORT_ES6 option does not work as described at
// https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/6284, so we have to
// manually add this by '--post-js' setting when the Emscripten compilation.
//
// This line will be pasted right behind the emscripten generated code and
// defines that the Module is exported as default. It seems that the wasm loader
// in chrome requires exactly this!
//
// A good explanation is here:
// https://24ways.org/2014/javascript-modules-the-es6-way/
//
export default Module;
